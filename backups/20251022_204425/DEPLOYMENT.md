## 🚀 Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Railway Account & Project
1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up/in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your `werewolveshx` repository

### 2. Add PostgreSQL Database
1. In your Railway project, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Go to your app service → "Variables" and ensure these are set:
- `DATABASE_URL` (auto-set by Railway when you add PostgreSQL)
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT` (auto-set by Railway)

### 4. Deploy
Railway will automatically:
- Detect the Node.js application
- Run `npm ci && npm run build` (build command)
- Start the server with `npm start`
- Run database migrations after deployment

## 🔧 Application Architecture

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
**Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript + WebSocket
**Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
**Real-time**: WebSocket for game interactions
**Authentication**: Session-based with Passport.js

## 🎮 Game Features Ready for Production

- Real-time multiplayer Werewolf/Mafia game
- Multiple roles: Werewolf, Seer, Doctor, Sheriff, etc.
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Interactive chat system
- Responsive mobile-friendly UI
- Proper game state management
- Database persistence for games and players

## 🔍 Health Check

The application includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health` for Railway monitoring.

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Build Time**: ~30-60 seconds
- **Cold Start**: <10 seconds
- **WebSocket Connections**: Properly configured for Railway's infrastructure
- **Database**: Optimized queries with Drizzle ORM

## 🎯 Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:
1. Test the game creation and joining flow
2. Verify WebSocket connections work properly
3. Test database persistence across sessions
4. Monitor Railway logs for any issues

Your GameWorldQuest application is now production-ready for Railway! 🎉
