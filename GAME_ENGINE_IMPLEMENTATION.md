# Game Engine Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarises the complete implementation of the Werewolf game engine, transforming the application from a basic infrastructure into a fully playable game.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File: `shared/schema.ts`**
- Added `nightCount`, `dayCount`, `lastPhaseChange`, and `phaseEndTime` to games table
- These fields enable proper phase tracking and timer management

**File: `db/migrations/10_add_phase_tracking.sql`** (NEW)
- Migration script to add new columns to the games table
- Run this migration on the production database before deploying

### 2. Core Game Engine Implementation
**File: `server/services/gameLogic.ts`** (MAJOR REFACTOR - 500+ lines added)

#### Key Functions Added:

**Phase Management:**
- `advancePhase()` - Automatically transitions between phases (role_reveal → night → day → voting → night cycle)
- `startPhaseTimer()` - Manages phase timers with early completion detection
- `checkPhaseActionsComplete()` - Monitors if required actions are completed (>50% threshold)

**Action Resolution:**
- `resolveNightActions()` - Processes all night actions in correct priority order:
  1. Shield (highest priority)
  2. Doctor heal
  3. Bodyguard protection (with special death mechanic)
  4. Werewolf kill
- Implements bodyguard special rule: If bodyguard dies whilst protecting someone, that person also dies (unless shielded/healed)

**Vote Resolution:**
- `resolveVoting()` - Tallies votes with Sheriff counting as 2 votes
- Handles tie scenarios (no elimination on tie)
- Eliminates player with most votes

**Win Condition Checking:**
- `checkWinCondition()` - Checks after each elimination:
  - Village wins: All werewolves eliminated
  - Werewolf wins: Werewolves ≥ villagers
- Broadcasts game_over event with winner

**Event System:**
- Creates announcement messages for deaths, protections, eliminations
- Events are broadcast to all players and shown as toasts

**Phase Timers Updated:**
- Day: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- Night: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- Voting: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- Role Reveal: 15 seconds

#### Early Phase Completion:
- Checks every 5 seconds if phase can end early
- Night phase: Ends when >50% of werewolves have voted
- Voting phase: Ends when >50% of alive players have voted
- Respects user requirement: "No point waiting for timer if actions complete"

### 3. Game State Structure Fixed
**File: `server/services/gameLogic.ts` - `getGameState()` function**
- Now computes and returns `alivePlayers` and `deadPlayers` arrays
- Adds `werewolfCount` and `villagerCount` for easy access
- Includes `phase` as alias for backwards compatibility
- Returns complete phase information (nightCount, dayCount, phaseTimer)

### 4. Storage Layer Updates
**File: `server/storage.ts`**
- Updated `updateGame()` to handle new fields:
  - nightCount, dayCount, lastPhaseChange, phaseEndTime
- Ensures all new schema fields can be properly updated

### 5. Client-Side TypeScript Updates
**File: `client/src/lib/gameTypes.ts`**
- Updated `Game` interface to match new schema
- Added `phase` alias for backwards compatibility
- Changed date fields to accept both Date and string types

### 6. Client Hooks Fixed
**File: `client/src/hooks/useGameState.ts`**
- Fixed phase access to check multiple possible locations:
  - `gameState.game.currentPhase`
  - `gameState.game.phase`
  - `gameState.phase`
- Added handlers for new WebSocket messages:
  - `phase_change` - Shows events (deaths, eliminations) as toasts
  - `game_over` - Displays game over overlay with winner
- Properly resets overlays on phase transitions

### 7. UI Component Updates
**File: `client/src/components/werewolf/GameScreen.tsx`**
- Fixed phase display to access correct nested properties
- Displays night count and day count properly
- Fixed action button visibility based on phase
- Shield button now checks player's actual `hasShield` property

**File: `client/src/components/werewolf/Chat.tsx`**
- Fixed phase access for proper "Silent Night" / "Deceased" messaging

## How It Works

### Game Flow
```
1. Game Created (Lobby)
2. Host Starts Game
3. Role Reveal (15 seconds) - Players see their roles
4. ↓
5. Night Phase (2 minutes or early completion)
   - Werewolves vote on kill target
   - Seer investigates (optional)
   - Doctor heals (optional)
   - Bodyguard protects (optional)
   - Players can use shield (once per game)
6. ↓
7. Day Phase (3 minutes)
   - Night results announced (deaths, protections)
   - Players discuss and chat
   - Events shown as toasts
8. ↓
9. Voting Phase (2 minutes or early completion)
   - Players vote to eliminate someone
   - Sheriff vote counts as 2
   - >50% voting ends phase early
10. ↓
11. Check Win Conditions
    - If game over: Show winner
    - Else: Return to Night Phase (step 5)
```

### Action Priority Order
When night ends, actions are resolved in this order:
1. **Shield** - Personal protection (highest priority)
2. **Doctor** - Heal target
3. **Bodyguard** - Protection (bodyguard dies if target attacked)
4. **Werewolf Kill** - Final action

This ensures shields and heals can prevent deaths.

### Early Phase Completion
- System checks every 5 seconds if phase can end
- Night: Ends when ≥50% of werewolves have acted
- Voting: Ends when ≥50% of alive players have voted
- Prevents unnecessary waiting

### Bodyguard Special Mechanic
- If bodyguard is killed whilst protecting someone, that person also dies
- UNLESS that person has shield or is healed by doctor
- Implements your specific requirement correctly

## Testing Checklist

## Deployment Instructions

### Local Development
1. No additional steps needed - schema will auto-update on dev
2. Just run `npm run dev` as usual

### Production Deployment (Railway)
1. **IMPORTANT**: Run database migration first:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE games 
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS night_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS day_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_phase_change TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS phase_end_time TIMESTAMP;
   ```

2. Deploy the code:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement complete game engine with phase progression"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Railway will auto-deploy from main branch
